## ‚ö†Ô∏è Wi-Fi Library Notice

This project currently uses a **C library for Eduroam Wi-Fi connection**.  
When running the code, you might encounter a **red deprecation warning**. This is expected.

- ‚úÖ The current (deprecated) library **still works**.
- ‚ùå The **suggested replacement library** in the warning message **does not work properly**, so we continue to use the current setup.

Feel free to contribute a fix or improvement for the Wi-Fi connection method if you discover a better alternative.
