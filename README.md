# Final_Project
In order to get this project started:
First: open Arduino IDE and find the boards manager
Second: look for esp32 and install the 3.2.0 version

Third: when trying to connect the board, make sure usb-c connection is stable, and for the board selection, we have ESP32-S3-DevKit board



Warning:
Right now, we use a C library for eduroam wifi connection, when running the code you can see the red warning, and that package is deprecated, but it can still work, the suggestions package from the warning is not working, so we still go with current package.
